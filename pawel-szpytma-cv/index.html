            I am a training programmer, looking for possibilities to start a career in the software industry where
I’ll get an opportunity to expand my knowledge. My beginnings with programming started when I
was studying Tourism and Recreation by doing some basic stuff in CSS and HTML just for fun. I
continually look for opportunities to develop myself, and I recently completed a programming Boot
camp and multiple courses online. I am able to find creative solutions to technical problems and am
excellent when learning new skills.
